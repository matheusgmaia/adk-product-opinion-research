## Product Report: Nintendo Switch 2

**Product Name:** Nintendo Switch 2

**Summary of the Product:**
The Nintendo Switch 2 is the highly anticipated successor to the original Nintendo Switch. It features a significantly larger 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and HDR support. The console is physically bigger, yet described as feeling more refined and sturdier. Key hardware upgrades include new, larger Joy-Cons with a magnetic attachment system, steel SL/SR buttons, and an innovative optical sensor on each Joy-Con allowing them to function as a mouse. Internal storage has been increased to 256GB (from 32GB on the original) and supports microSD Express cards. The redesigned dock now outputs 4K resolution to a TV and includes a cooling fan.

New software and social features are prominent, including "Game Chat" with screen sharing (usable with an optional Switch 2 Camera accessory) and "GameShare," allowing one user to share a game locally with up to three other Switch 2 consoles that don't own the game. The console is backward compatible with most Switch 1 games, and some Switch 1 games will receive "Switch 2 Edition" paid upgrades.

While the hardware improvements and new features are generally praised, significant concerns revolve around the pricing strategy. The console itself is priced at $449, with native Switch 2 games reportedly costing $80-$90. Additional costs include a paid demo game ("Welcome Tour"), paid upgrades for some older titles, and a new Pro Controller. The overall sentiment is that while the Switch 2 offers a substantial and welcome evolution, its higher cost of entry and ownership is a notable point of contention.

**Summary For Each Video:**

*   **Marques Brownlee (MKBHD):**
    MKBHD provides a positive first look, stating Nintendo "hit every single one" of the anticipated updates. He highlights the much-improved larger 120Hz LCD screen, the redesigned and bigger Joy-Cons with their satisfying magnetic attachment and surprising mouse functionality, increased storage, and 4K dock output. He also appreciates new social features like Game Chat and GameShare. His main reservations are the potential durability of the Joy-Con connector pins on the console and, more significantly, the high price of new games (around $80-$90) and the decision to charge for the "Welcome Tour" demo game, which he calls a "huge miss." He considers the console's $449 price reasonable given the upgrades. Overall, he's very optimistic about the Switch 2.

*   **Mrwhosetheboss:**
    Mrwhosetheboss describes the Switch 2 as a "grown-up," more sophisticated and powerful console. He extensively praises the "freaking phenomenal" 7.9-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD (even preferring its colors to the Switch OLED), the sturdier build quality, and the "insane" and "smart" Joy-Con mouse feature. He notes the improved ergonomics of the larger Joy-Cons. However, a central theme of his review is the concern over cost, stating users might feel "overcharged" in many ways. He criticizes the console's price, the "new industry highs" for game prices, paid upgrades for older games, the paid demo game, and voice chat being locked behind a subscription. While impressed by the hardware and many features like GameShare, the overall pricing strategy is a major point of concern for him. He also notes the lack of any announcement regarding a fix for Joy-Con drift as "alarming."

**List of Informations:**

    *   Size: 7.9-inch (up from 6.2-inch).
    *   Type: LCD (not OLED).
    *   Resolution: 1080p.

    *   Mouse Functionality: Each Joy-Con has a small optical sensor on the side, allowing it to be used as a mouse on flat surfaces (including laps).
    *   Durability: Concerns raised by MKBHD about pins on the Switch for Joy-Con connection. Mrwhosetheboss feels the mechanism is robust. No official word on Joy-Con drift fix.
*   **Ports:**
    *   Additional USB Type-C port on the top of the console (besides the bottom one), allowing charging in tabletop mode.

    *   New games (e.g., Mario Kart World) show more detail, better effects, run at 60fps. Graphics described as improved but not PS5-level, with some aliasing noted. Extra power seems geared towards larger worlds and more complex game design.
*   **Software Features:**
    *   **Game Chat:** New menu via 'C' button for voice chat and screen sharing with friends. Mic is on the console.
    *   **Switch 2 Camera:** Optional $50 accessory for video chat, plugs into the top port or dock, can automatically cut out background.

*   **Online Services:** Voice chat (part of Game Chat) is reportedly locked behind an online subscription paywall. Concerns about whether online server quality will improve.

**Information Disagreements:**
*   There are no direct factual disagreements on specifications between the two videos. Differences lie more in the interpretation of durability or emphasis on certain features.

**Agreed Upon Opinions:**

*   The Nintendo Switch 2 is a significant and welcome upgrade over the original.
*   The larger 7.9-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD screen is a major improvement and looks excellent.
*   The new Joy-Cons are more ergonomic due to their larger size, and the magnetic attachment system is well-implemented and secure.
*   The Joy-Con mouse functionality (using optical sensors) is an innovative, surprising, and impressive feature.
*   The increase to 256GB of internal storage is a much-needed improvement.
*   The new dock's ability to output 4K resolution is a positive step.
*   The "GameShare" feature is a great addition for local multiplayer.
*   There is strong concern and criticism regarding the high price of new Switch 2 games (e.g., $80-$90).
*   The decision to charge for the "Welcome Tour" demo game is widely seen as a negative move or a "missed opportunity."
*   Backward compatibility with Switch 1 games is a good and appreciated feature.
*   The console feels noticeably bigger and more substantial than its predecessor.
*   The addition of a top-mounted USB-C port is a convenient quality-of-life improvement for charging in tabletop mode.

**Not Agreed Upon Opinions:**

*   **Console Price ($449):**
    *   MKBHD: Considers it a "pretty reasonable price" given the upgrades, time since the original, inflation, etc.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: Views it as part of a broader pattern of feeling "overcharged" and a "problem."
*   **Overall Sentiment on Cost vs. Value:**
    *   MKBHD: Generally very positive about the console, with pricing of games and the demo being the main "asterisk."
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: While acknowledging significant improvements, the theme of high costs and feeling "overcharged" is a dominant and critical concern throughout his review.
*   **LCD Screen Quality Nuance:**
    *   MKBHD: Notes it's an LCD (not OLED, so no perfect blacks or OLED battery benefits) and anticipates a future Switch 2 OLED model.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: Was initially skeptical about the LCD but found its quality "freaking phenomenal" and surprisingly stated its color reproduction is *better* than the existing Switch OLED model.
*   **Assessment of New Game Graphics (e.g., Mario Kart World):**
    *   MKBHD: Focuses more on games taking advantage of new features.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: Describes Mario Kart World's graphics as "pretty good" but not "blown away," noting some aliasing and simple textures, clarifying it's not at PS5 levels, but acknowledges the power seems to be invested in improved world design.
*   **Joy-Con Durability Concerns vs. Robustness:**
    *   MKBHD: Expresses specific worry about the long-term durability of the new connector pins on the Switch console itself. Lists Joy-Con drift as a TBD item.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: Feels the Joy-Con attachment mechanism and connector seem robust and difficult to accidentally snap. He is, however, "very alarming" that Nintendo hasn't addressed or mentioned any fix for the pre-existing Joy-Con drift issue.
*   **Paid Upgrades for Switch 1 Games:**
    *   MKBHD: Mentions paying a "smaller amount" and hopes it's not full price for updates.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: More critical, calling paid upgrade packs "not really the norm" and expressing concern that developers might charge extra for minimal improvements.
*   **Game Chat Microphone Quality Concerns:**
    *   MKBHD: Does not comment on potential mic quality.
    *   Mrwhosetheboss: Expresses "significant doubts" about the console-mounted microphone's ability to pick up voice clearly when the Switch is docked near a TV.
