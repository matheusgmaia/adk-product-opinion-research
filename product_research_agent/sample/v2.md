## Praises and Criticisms: What the Reviewers are Saying

*   **A Visual Feast...But Not a PlayStation 5 Killer:** Across the board, reviewers are impressed with the Switch 2's display. Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) notes that it [“looks so much better than the original Switch”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=74s). However, Mrwhosetheboss cautions that the graphical upgrades, while noticeable, aren't mind-blowing, stating that they [“won't be confusing these games with PlayStation 5 games”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=591s).
*   **Joy-Cons Reimagined: A Magnetic Attraction:** Reviewers are loving the magnetic connection. Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) described the magnetic connection as [“really satisfying”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=175s). The larger size is also a hit, making them more comfortable to hold and use for extended gaming sessions.
*   **The Social Switch: Connecting with Friends, Near and Far:** The new Game Chat and screen sharing features are generating buzz, with reviewers noting how they'll transform the Switch 2 into a more [“social and connected console”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=415s).
*   **Mouse Mode: Innovation at its Finest:** The ability to use the Joy-Cons as a mouse is being hailed as a stroke of genius, opening up new possibilities for game design and control, especially for strategy games, simulations and puzzle games.
*   **Pricey Proposition: Is It Worth the Cost?** The $449 starting price is raising eyebrows, especially when [compared to the original Switch's launch price of $299](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=37s). Mrwhosetheboss views it as [part of a larger feeling of being “overcharged”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=42s). This could make the Switch 2 a tougher sell for budget-conscious gamers, although some argue that increased development costs justify the higher prices.
*   **Game Costs Could Break the Bank:** The rumored $80-$90 price tag for new Switch 2 games is causing concern, particularly [for digital downloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=664s). Gamers are worried about the long-term cost of building a Switch 2 library.
*   **Demo with a Price Tag? Ouch!** Nintendo's decision to charge for the "Welcome Tour" demo game is facing backlash, seen as a missed opportunity to showcase the console's features. Reviewers are pointing to the example of free, built-in tutorials on other consoles. This is especially concerning given that a key point is that [“so many people that are not going to experience it”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=736s).
*   **Joy-Con Drift: The Ghost of Switches Past:** The elephant in the room is the dreaded Joy-Con drift. The fact that Nintendo hasn't addressed this issue is a major red flag for potential buyers.

## Battery Life: A Big Question Mark

*   While concrete details are scarce, reviewers are only speculating about battery life, noting that the larger, higher refresh rate screen could put a strain on it. However, the bigger console size could also accommodate a larger battery, potentially balancing things out. The big question remains: [“how similar or different will battery life potentially be from the first Switch?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=786s)

## Game Share Feature: Share the Fun (and the Cost!)

*   This feature is an exciting prospect for families and friend groups who love to game together. Imagine being able to easily share new games with your friends during a party, or letting your kids try out a game before you commit to buying it for each of them. Imagine a family road trip where only one parent needs to buy a game for all the kids to play together! However, details are still emerging about [which games will support Game Share and any potential limitations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=569s), and a stable internet connection may be required for the host console.
