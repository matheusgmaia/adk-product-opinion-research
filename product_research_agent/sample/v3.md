## Nintendo Switch 2: A "Grown-Up" Successor with a Pricey Proposition

The Nintendo Switch 2 has officially landed, and early hands-on impressions paint a picture of a significantly evolved console that many have eagerly awaited. It's widely regarded as a "grown-up version of the Switch One" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=15s) - Mrwhosetheboss), boasting substantial upgrades across the board, from a stunning new display to more ergonomic and feature-rich Joy-Cons. Both reviewers agree Nintendo has "hit every single one of those things" users were waiting for ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=35s) - MKBHD). This iteration isn't just about raw power; it's about a suite of thoughtful quality-of-life upgrades that collectively contribute to a significantly more polished, mature, and user-friendly experience compared to its predecessor. However, this impressive leap forward comes with a "big asterisk" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=37s) - MKBHD): a noticeably higher price for the console, its accessories, and particularly its games, sparking a debate about overall value and leaving some feeling potentially "overcharged" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=41s) - Mrwhosetheboss). It's a console that promises a much-improved experience but demands a premium investment.

### Key Features: What's New and What It Means for You

The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just a minor refresh; it's packed with upgrades designed to enhance your gaming experience:

*   **A Display That Dazzles**: Get ready for a more immersive visual feast! The screen has grown to a generous **7.9-inch LCD** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=61s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=56s)). It now boasts a crisp **1080p resolution** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=68s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=221s)) and a super-smooth **120Hz variable refresh rate** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=68s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=276s)). This means games will not only look sharper but also feel more fluid, and developers can even lock the screen to lower refresh rates like 30Hz to save battery for demanding games ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=306s)). It's brighter, supports HDR for more vibrant colors ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=79s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=214s)), and Mrwhosetheboss was so impressed he felt its LCD color reproduction even outshone the Switch OLED model ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=268s)).
*   **Joy-Cons Reimagined**: Your hands will thank you. The new Joy-Cons are **bigger and more ergonomic** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=162s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=348s)), which means longer, more comfortable play sessions, especially for those with larger hands, reducing fatigue and potentially improving control. They now **attach magnetically** with a deeply satisfying click ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=175s)) and feel noticeably sturdier, like an integral part of the console ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=138s)). Enjoy **larger analog sticks** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=166s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=377s)), more accessible and larger secondary shoulder buttons ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=215s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=352s)), and **improved "HD Rumble 2" haptics** for more precise and immersive feedback ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=259s)).
*   **Surprise! Joy-Cons Double as Mice**: In a stroke of Nintendo ingenuity, each Joy-Con now features a **small optical sensor** on its side ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=281s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=412s)). This allows them to function as surprisingly responsive computer mice when placed on a flat surface (even your lap ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=313s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=476s))!). This opens up intuitive new control schemes for various game genres—imagine building levels in *Mario Maker 3* or navigating strategy games like *Civilization 7* with newfound precision ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=454s)) – no extra accessories needed!
*   **Upping the Social Game**:
    *   **Game Chat & Screen Share**: A new **'C' button** on the Joy-Cons ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=168s)) instantly brings up a new menu called Game Chat ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=433s)), allowing you to talk with friends and even share your screen live during gameplay ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=448s)).
    *   **Switch 2 Camera (Optional)**: For $50 ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=642s)), this little accessory ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=491s)) plugs in and can automatically cut you out from your background ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=503s)), placing your face alongside your gameplay for your friends to see.
    *   **GameShare**: A fantastic feature allowing one Switch 2 owner to host a game and let up to three friends (who don't own the game) join in for local multiplayer fun ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=543s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=908s)). This means more spontaneous fun with friends without everyone needing to own every title.
*   **Docked Powerhouse with 4K**: When you're ready for the big screen, the redesigned dock now outputs up to **4K resolution to your TV** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=397s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=522s)). It even includes a **built-in fan** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=401s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=510s)) to keep the console cool while it's pushing out those extra pixels, ensuring smooth performance during demanding TV play.
*   **More Games, Faster Access**: Say goodbye to constant storage juggling! The internal storage has been massively boosted to **256GB (from 32GB) and it's faster too** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=346s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=901s)), meaning more of your favorite games are ready to play at a moment's notice. Need more? Thankfully, there is **still microSD card support** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=375s)). You'll specifically need a **microSD Express card** to play games off it ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=380s)).
*   **Charge & Play Convenience**: A much-requested **second USB-C port has been added to the top** of the console ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=140s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=95s)). This means you can finally charge the Switch 2 while it's propped up in tabletop mode or connect accessories without blocking the main charging port at the bottom, a huge win for versatility.
*   **A Stand That Stands Up**: The flimsy kickstand of old is gone, replaced by a **sturdy, full-width kickstand** similar to the Switch OLED model ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=132s)), offering much better stability and a wider variety of viewing angles for tabletop play ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=177s)).

### Common Praises: What Reviewers Loved

The Nintendo Switch 2 has garnered significant praise for several key upgrades that meaningfully enhance the user experience:

*   **A Truly Transformed Display**: This is the star of the show! The larger, brighter, 1080p, 120Hz variable refresh rate screen is universally celebrated as a "massive improvement" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=126s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=208s)). Games look "so much better" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=74s)) and "freaking phenomenal" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=253s)), making for a far more immersive and visually pleasing experience. Mrwhosetheboss was so impressed he even declared its LCD colors superior to the Switch OLED ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=268s))!
*   **Joy-Cons: Better Feel, Smarter Design**: The redesigned Joy-Cons are a big hit. They're larger and "ergonomically is very welcome" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=164s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=348s)), and the new magnetic attachment is described as "really satisfying" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=175s)). They feel more like a serious gaming tool than a toy ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=329s)).
*   **"Insanely" Innovative Mouse Feature**: The unexpected ability for Joy-Cons to function as optical mice blew reviewers away ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=277s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=428s)). This "smart" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=433s)) addition is lauded for opening up exciting new gameplay possibilities without requiring extra peripherals.
*   **Thoughtful Quality of Life Upgrades**: The addition of a top USB-C port for easier charging in tabletop mode is hailed as a prayer answered ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=98s), [source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=142s)). The much-improved kickstand ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=132s)) and the substantial increase in internal storage ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=351s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=901s)) are also highly appreciated, addressing common pain points of the original. Collectively, these numerous smaller improvements contribute to a significantly more polished, mature, and user-friendly experience compared to the original Switch, really showing Nintendo listened to feedback.
*   **GameShare is a Multiplayer Win**: The ability for one player to share their game with up to three friends locally, even if they don't own it, is seen as a "best thing" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=906s)) and a feature MKBHD "likes a lot" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=576s)). This significantly lowers the barrier to local multiplayer fun.
*   **Backward Compatibility Appreciated**: Nintendo "should be credited" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=737s)) for ensuring that your existing library of Switch 1 games will work on the Switch 2 right out of the box ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=593s)).

---

### Common Criticisms: Potential Dealbreakers and Frustrations

Despite the many improvements, several aspects of the Nintendo Switch 2 have drawn criticism, primarily centered around cost and lingering concerns:

*   **Sky-High Game Prices**: This is a major red flag for both reviewers. New **Switch 2 games are expected to cost around $80 for digital versions** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=662s), with Mrwhosetheboss citing Mario Kart at $80 [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=814s)) and **$90 for physical copies** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=667s)). This is described as "definitely feels really high" ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=669s)) and "new industry highs" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=824s)), potentially making building a game library a very expensive endeavor.
*   **Paying for the Tutorial**: The "Welcome Tour" demo game, designed to showcase the Switch 2's features, **is not free and will cost around $10-$20** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=729s)). Both MKBHD ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=736s)) and Mrwhosetheboss ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=860s)) call this a "huge miss" and question the decision, as it means many users might not fully experience or understand their new console.
*   **Joy-Con Durability and the Ghost of Drift**: While the new Joy-Cons are improved, MKBHD expressed concern about the **durability of the connector pins on the Switch body** ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=241s) for pins, [source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=243s) for concern). More significantly, Mrwhosetheboss finds it "really weird" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=384s)) and "alarming" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=406s)) that Nintendo has **made no mention of fixing the infamous Joy-Con drift issue** that plagued the original Switch, calling it a "very major thing" ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=403s)). This silence is a point of anxiety for potential buyers.
*   **The Price of "Upgraded" Older Games**: Mrwhosetheboss highlighted that users will have to **pay for "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" upgrade packs** to get enhanced versions of their old Switch 1 games. He notes this is "not really the norm" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=777s)), as other platforms often offer such enhancements for free, raising concerns about being charged extra for minor improvements.
*   **Game Chat Behind a Paywall**: The new Game Chat voice feature, while cool, is **locked behind Nintendo's online subscription service** ([source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=853s)). Mrwhosetheboss questions why such a fundamental feature for online play isn't included as standard.
*   **Still an LCD, Not OLED**: While the new LCD is a massive step up, MKBHD points out that **it's not an OLED panel**. This means users won't get those "perfectly inky blacks" or the potential battery life benefits often associated with OLED technology ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=81s)).

### Reviewer Showdown: Where Opinions Diverge

While there's broad agreement on many aspects, our reviewers had some notable differences in perspective:

*   **The $449 Console Price Tag: Reasonable or Overpriced?**
    *   **Marques Brownlee (MKBHD)** considers the $449 price for the console itself **"pretty reasonable"** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=640s)). He argues that when you factor in "new specs and updates and inflation and tariffs and all of that," the price feels justified, especially considering the original Switch launched almost a decade ago ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=634s)).
    *   **Mrwhosetheboss**, however, views the $449 price as the starting point of a broader "problem" where "what also appears to have grown up with it is the price" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=31s)). He expresses a general feeling of being **"overcharged"** and not "getting the things that you feel like you should for what you're paying" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=41s)), suggesting the console price itself contributes to this sentiment.

*   **Overall Value Proposition Amidst Pricing Concerns:**
    *   **Marques Brownlee (MKBHD)**, despite his criticisms of game and demo pricing, ultimately concludes the Switch 2 **"seems pretty sweet, not gonna lie. I really like it"** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=750s)). His "big asterisk" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=37s)) is primarily focused on software costs, with the hardware itself receiving a more favorable pass due to its significant upgrades.
    *   **Mrwhosetheboss** expresses a more pervasive concern about being **"overcharged"** that colors his entire assessment. This feeling extends beyond just game prices to include paid game upgrades and paywalled features like voice chat ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=777s), [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=853s)). His take suggests a broader disappointment with Nintendo's overall pricing strategy, potentially impacting the console's inherent value proposition despite its strong hardware.

*   **The LCD Screen: Great... But is it OLED-Great?**
    *   **Marques Brownlee (MKBHD)**, while acknowledging the LCD is much improved, explicitly points out its limitations compared to OLED technology: **"it doesn't have the perfectly inky blacks or the battery life advantages that come with an OLED"** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=81s)). He even speculates about a future "Switch 2 OLED" model ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=93s)), implying the current screen, while good, isn't the ultimate display.
    *   **Mrwhosetheboss** is unequivocally enthusiastic about the new LCD, calling it **"freaking phenomenal"** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=253s)). In a surprising comparison, he states, **"I actually think the color reproduction on this LCD display comes out on top" when put side-by-side with the Nintendo Switch OLED** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=268s)). He gives the display a "10 from me" ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=318s)), largely downplaying any potential drawbacks of it being an LCD rather than OLED.

### Consensus Corner: What They Both Agreed On

Despite some differing opinions, there were several key areas where both MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss were in complete agreement, highlighting these as major wins or universal truths about the Switch 2:

*   **Massive Display Upgrade is a Game Changer**: Both reviewers unequivocally agree that the **larger, 1080p, 120Hz variable refresh rate screen is a significant and highly impressive improvement** over the original, making games look and feel substantially better ([source K3CR6RiWS2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=74s), [source _5hSp3pHHjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=208s)).
