## NIKE ALPHAFLY 3: Early Reviews Report

**Product Name:** NIKE ALPHAFLY 3
**Report Date:** December 16, 2023

### 1. Introduction

The Nike Alphafly 3 has stormed onto the scene, and early reviews overwhelmingly suggest it's not just an update, but a significant course correction that aims to restore the shoe to its legendary status in elite marathon racing. After a polarizing Alphafly 2, the sentiment for version 3 is remarkably positive. Reviewers from **Believe in the Run**, **Run Testers**, and **Kofuzi** are enthusiastic about its substantially lighter weight, redesigned continuous midsole, and enhanced comfort. Many, like **Believe in the Run**, declare that the "magic is back" ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=118s)), while **Kofuzi** notes it "feels like a true successor to the original Alphafly" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=57s)), a sentiment echoed by its record-breaking performances even before public release ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=23s)). The core excitement revolves around a shoe that delivers the expected propulsive power but now with a smoother, more stable, and more accommodating ride. While the anticipation is high, considerations around long-term durability, its suitability for all running styles, and the premium price point remain.

### 2. Key Features

The Alphafly 3 introduces several pivotal updates and refinements aimed at elevating performance and overall user experience:

*   **All-New Continuous Midsole:**
    *   Nike has transitioned to a single, continuous piece of ZoomX foam for the midsole, eliminating the "decoupled" design of previous versions (where sections of the midsole were visibly separated, potentially leading to a more disjointed or "mechanical" feel) ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=210s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=55s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=204s)). The bottom features a substantial cutout down the center, which **Kofuzi** highlights as key for weight saving and allowing the foam to splay ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=288s)).
    *   **Benefit:** This construction yields a markedly smoother heel-to-toe transition ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=344s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=281s)), described by **Kofuzi** as feeling "so much more cohesive" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=209s)). It offers a ride that feels more connected and less like the "two distinct parts" sensation noted by **BITR** in older models ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=350s)). It also contributes to a more aggressive, "tippy forward feeling" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=283s)).

*   **Atomknit 3.0 Upper:**
    *   The upper utilizes Nike's latest Atomknit iteration, engineered for minimal weight, enhanced structure, and breathability ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=135s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=112s)). It integrates lofted flyknit yarns in the midfoot for better containment and has a more structured, padded heel collar ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=118s)). The material is also hydrophobic ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=159s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Provides a comfortable, secure, sock-like fit ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=152s)) with improved lockdown compared to previous versions ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=151s)). It aims to reduce irritation, particularly around the arch, which **Run Testers** confirms Nike addressed ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=97s)).

*   **Significant Weight Reduction:**
    *   The Alphafly 3 is lauded as the "lightest Alphafly ever" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=31s)). **Believe in the Run** weighed their size 10.5 at 7.75 oz (approx. 220g) ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=281s)). **Run Testers** found their UK size 9 (US 10) weighed 220g (7.7 oz) ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=33s)). **Kofuzi** measured his US men's size 9.5 at 7.4 oz (approx. 210g) ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=385s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Reduced weight translates to energy savings over long distances like a marathon ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=275s)) and a more nimble, agile feel ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=296s)), making the shoe feel less "bottom-heavy" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=395s)).

*   **Optimized Air Zoom Pod Engagement:**
    *   Foam has been carved out from around the forefoot Air Zoom pods ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=232s)).
    *   **Benefit:** This allows the pods more room to compress and expand, potentially enhancing the bouncy sensation and responsiveness ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=240s)), contributing to the signature Alphafly "pop."

*   **Widened Carbon Fiber FlyPlate & Increased Base Width:**
    *   The full-length carbon fiber plate has been widened ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=92s)). The overall base of the shoe, particularly in the midfoot and heel, is also wider ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=318s)).
    *   **Benefit:** These design changes aim to increase stability throughout the gait cycle ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=93s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=322s)), making the shoe feel less "wild" than the original Alphafly ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=506s)).

*   **Improved Arch Comfort:**
    *   Nike specifically addressed arch irritation, a known issue for some with prior Alphafly models ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=201s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=97s)). **Kofuzi** notes the arch feels "a lot more accommodating" and less intrusive ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=172s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Reviewers confirmed the arch feels "tamed," leading to a more comfortable experience without hot spots ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=204s)).

*   **Fast Shot Outsole:**
    *   Features a new "Fast Shot" rubber pattern with minimal heel coverage and more substantial forefoot coverage under the pods ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=140s)). **Kofuzi** describes it as a "painted-on rubber" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=344s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Provides good grip in various conditions, including wet pavement ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=412s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=157s)). Initial impressions on durability are cautiously optimistic ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=662s)), though **Kofuzi** expresses it as a "durability question mark" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=355s)).

### 4. Common Praises

Reviewers were largely united in their enthusiastic praise for the Alphafly 3:

*   **Return of the "Magic" & Superior Feel:** All three channels emphatically stated this version is a huge improvement and a return to what made the original great. **Believe in the Run** declared "the magic is back" ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=118s)). **Run Testers** labeled it an "absolutely outstanding racing shoe" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=579s)). **Kofuzi** felt it's a "worthy successor to the Alphafly 1" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=714s)) and praised its "great blend of softness, bounce, and aggression" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=690s)).
*   **Significant Weight Reduction:** The drop in weight was universally lauded for making the shoe feel nimbler, more efficient, and less cumbersome ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=255s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=31s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=391s)).
*   **Smoother, More Cohesive Ride:** The new continuous midsole is a standout improvement, providing a seamless and fluid transition that all reviewers loved ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=344s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=281s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=490s)).
*   **Exceptional Upper Comfort & Fit:** The Atomknit 3.0 upper received high marks for its secure, comfortable, breathable, and improved fit over previous versions ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=133s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=174s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=146s)).
*   **Signature Propulsion and Bounce:** The Alphafly 3 retains the explosive energy return expected, with the Air Zoom pods delivering a distinct and enjoyable pop ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=246s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=322s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=471s)).
*   **Improved Stability:** The widened base and plate contribute to a more stable ride compared to its predecessors, particularly the V1 ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=506s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=93s)).
*   **Versatility at Faster Paces:** While a premier marathon shoe, it felt great for a range of faster paces, including 5K, 10K, and tempo efforts ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=513s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=335s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=580s)).
*   **Improved Arch Support/Comfort:** The "tamed" arch design effectively addressed irritation points from previous models, making it more accommodating ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=204s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=172s)).
*   **Reliable Grip:** The Fast Shot outsole performed well in initial tests, even in wet conditions ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=416s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=157s)).

### 5. Common Criticisms

While overwhelmingly positive, reviewers highlighted a few considerations:

*   **Optimal for Forceful Runners/Midfoot-Forefoot Strikers:** **Run Testers** suggested that to extract maximum benefit, especially when fatiguing, runners who "put a lot of force in the shoe" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=423s)) will likely fare best. **Kofuzi** also felt it encourages a midfoot to forefoot strike and might feel "a little bit slappy if you're a heavy heel striker" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=530s)). This means if your running style is less powerful or more of a shuffle, you might not fully experience the shoe's propulsive benefits, especially when fatigued, potentially making other models a better value or fit for your needs.
*   **Minimal Heel Rubber & Outsole Durability Concerns:** **Believe in the Run** noted the minimal heel rubber is more for scuff protection than aggressive grip for heel strikers ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=434s)). **Kofuzi** explicitly called the thin outsole a "durability question mark" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=355s)), a sentiment shared implicitly by others given its minimal nature.
*   **Premium Price Point:** At $285, it remains a significant investment, typical for flagship racing shoes ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=26s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=53s)).
*   **Lacing Can Be Fiddly:** **Kofuzi** mentioned that while the lockdown is good, the lacing can be "a little bit fiddly to get dialed in just right" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=162s)).

### 6. Reviewer Showdown

Reviewers were largely aligned but offered nuanced perspectives in a few key areas:

*   **Perception of the Alphafly 2:**
    *   **Believe in the Run (BITR):** Had a strong negative reaction to the Alphafly 2, stating it "pretty much killed all your dreams" ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=32s)) and found it "slappy" ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=84s)). For them, the Alphafly 3 is a redemptive return to form.
    *   **Run Testers (RT):** Nick from Run Testers "really like[d] the Alphafly 2," describing it as a "very bouncy shoe" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=259s)), though acknowledging it "wasn't to everyone's taste" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=258s)).
    *   **Kofuzi (KOF):** Also found the Alphafly 2 "disappointing" and "clunky" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=70s)), stating the Alphafly 3 "feels like a true successor to the original Alphafly" in a way the V2 did not ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=57s)).

*   **Optimal Use Case / Runner Type Benefits:**
    *   **BITR:** Found the Alphafly 3 to "feel good at all Paces," suggesting broad pace versatility ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=513s)).
    *   **RT:** While agreeing it's great for fast paces, Nick felt it's "at its best when you are running well and or slightly more in cruise control" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=371s)), benefiting runners who "put a lot of force in the shoe" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=423s)).
    *   **KOF:** Agreed it excels at marathon to half marathon paces ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=591s)) and encourages a midfoot/forefoot strike. He felt it was "less versatile for heel strikers or slower paces" compared to something like the Vaporfly 3 ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=530s)).

*   **Comparison to Nike Vaporfly 3:**
    *   **BITR:** Stated the Alphafly 3 "rides more closely to the vaporfly but you still get that pop from the airpod" ([BITR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=336s)).
    *   **RT:** Concluded the Alphafly 3 "falls in between the Alphafly 2 and the Vaporfly 3" in ride feel ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=510s)). He found the AF3 and VF3 "more similar than I expected" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=515s)), but the Vaporfly 3 still felt "nimbler and lighter" and "a little bit more aggressive and racy" ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=527s)).
    *   **KOF:** Sees the Alphafly 3 as "more stable, more cushioned, and more bouncy" than the Vaporfly 3 ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=632s)). He positions the Vaporfly 3 as potentially more versatile for a wider range of footstrikes and paces, while the Alphafly 3 is "more of a purebred racer" for those who can leverage its design ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=650s)).

### 7. Unanswered Questions

Despite the glowing initial reviews, several questions remain for potential buyers:

*   **Long-Term Durability:** All reviews are based on relatively low mileage (65km for Run Testers, similar for Kofuzi's first run, though BITR mentions a contact with ~200 miles). The minimal outsole, particularly at the heel, is a key concern for longevity ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=355s), [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=162s)). The overall lifespan of the midsole foam and upper after several hundred miles is crucial for a $285 shoe.
    *   *Importance:* Durability is a major factor in the value proposition of such an expensive shoe.
*   **Performance for a Wider Spectrum of Runners:** While tested by experienced, often faster runners, how does the Alphafly 3 perform for true mid-pack, less forceful, or heavier heel-striking amateur runners? Reviewers like **RT** and **KOF** suggest it favors those who input more force or land further forward ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=423s), [KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=530s)).
    *   *Importance:* Many potential buyers will fall into this category and want to know if they can fully benefit from the shoe's technology or if another model would be more suitable.
*   **Direct Comparison to Key Competitors (e.g., Adidas Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1):** **Run Testers** mentioned the Pro Evo 1 as a major rival but had not yet tested it ([RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=620s)). **Kofuzi** also acknowledged its presence as a top-tier competitor ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=728s)).
    *   *Importance:* Head-to-head comparisons with other leading super shoes will be vital for consumers making purchasing decisions.
*   **Breathability and Comfort in Hot Conditions:** Reviews were generally conducted in cooler conditions. While the Atomknit 3.0 upper is described as breathable, its performance during hot summer marathons is yet to be fully assessed.
    *   *Importance:* Thermal comfort can significantly impact performance and overall race experience in warmer climates.

### 8. Concluding Thoughts

The Nike Alphafly 3 appears to be a resounding success, marking a triumphant return to the qualities that made the original a legend, while refining key aspects for an even better experience. It effectively addresses criticisms of its predecessor, particularly with the move to a continuous midsole for a smoother ride, a significant weight reduction, and an improved, more accommodating upper ([BITR "magic is back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJynQg2mMo&t=118s), [RT "outstanding racing shoe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=579s), [KOF "worthy successor"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=714s)).

Its core value proposition is clear: to help runners achieve personal bests over longer distances by offering an potent combination of cushioning, explosive energy return, and now, a more stable, fluid, and lighter ride. **Kofuzi** calls it "an absolute blast to run in" ([KOF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=702s)).

However, the premium price tag is a significant consideration. Furthermore, while versatile at fast paces, it seems to offer the most significant advantages to runners who can generate more force and utilize its aggressive, forward-propelling geometry, potentially favoring midfoot to forefoot strikers ([RT analysis on runner type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMf7gdJ6pc&t=423s), [KOF on footstrike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNVygVJfSC0&t=530s)). Long-term outsole durability remains the primary question mark. Overall, the Alphafly 3 has emphatically re-staked its claim at the pinnacle of racing shoe technology and will undoubtedly be a compelling choice for many runners targeting their fastest times.
