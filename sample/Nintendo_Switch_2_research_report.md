### Introduction

The Nintendo Switch 2 arrives as a highly anticipated successor to one of the most popular consoles of all time ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=10s)). Reviewers who got early access describe it as a "grown-up version of the Switch One" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=15s)), boasting a more sophisticated design, increased power, and features geared towards both casual and more serious gamers ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=23s)). MKBHD notes that Nintendo "basically, I think, hit every single one of those things" that users were waiting for in an update ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=34s)).

The main excitement revolves around its larger, improved display, revamped Joy-Cons, and enhanced performance capabilities. However, both reviewers highlight a significant "asterisk" – the price ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=37s)), not just for the console itself, but for games and supporting features, leading to feelings of being "overcharged" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=41s)).

### Key Features

The Switch 2 introduces a host of new and improved features aimed at enhancing the gaming experience:

*   **Larger, Upgraded Display:**
    *   The console now sports a **7.9-inch LCD display**, up from the original's 6.2 inches ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=61s)). HOC calls this "enormous" and notes it's "60% more total viewing area" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=59s)).
    *   It's a **1080p variable refresh rate (VRR) LCD** that goes up to **120Hz** and supports **HDR** ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=68s)). This results in a much better, brighter, and clearer look ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=74s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=208s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Provides a more immersive and visually appealing handheld experience. The 120Hz capability ensures smoother gameplay and UI responsiveness, especially noticeable in fast-moving games. Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) further enhances this by synchronizing the display's refresh rate with the game's frame output, reducing screen tearing and stutter for a consistently clear image. VRR also gives developers flexibility, allowing them to target higher frame rates for peak performance or lock to lower, stable frame rates (e.g., 30Hz) to conserve battery life during portable play, depending on the game's demands ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=288s)).
    *   Interestingly, HOC found the LCD's color reproduction to be "freaking phenomenal" and even potentially better than the Switch OLED's display ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=253s)).

*   **Redesigned & Improved Joy-Cons:**
    *   The Joy-Cons are **noticeably bigger**, offering better ergonomics ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=162s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=348s)).
    *   They now attach **magnetically** with a satisfying "slap" and auto-alignment, eliminating the slide mechanism ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=175s)). HOC notes they feel "very much like just part of the console" despite being magnetic ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=138s)).
    *   The SL and SR buttons are larger and made of **steel**, which contributes to the strong magnetic connection ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=221s)). HOC praises the improved accessibility of these buttons ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=352s)).
    *   A new **"C" button** is included for Game Chat functionality ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=168s)).
    *   **HD Rumble 2** offers stronger, more precise haptic feedback ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=261s)).
    *   **Joy-Con Mouse Functionality:** Each Joy-Con has a small optical sensor, allowing it to be used as a mouse on a flat surface (or even your lap) in supported games ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=272s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=410s)). HOC calls this an "insane feature that only Nintendo would try" and highlights its potential for genres like strategy games ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=430s)).
    *   **Benefit:** More comfortable and versatile control options, with innovative input methods opening up new gameplay possibilities.

*   **Enhanced Console Body & Dock:**
    *   The overall console is bigger but feels thinner due to its spread-out design ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=50s)). HOC describes it as feeling "sturdier" and more "refined" than the original Switch ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=101s)).
    *   Features a **full-width kickstand** similar to the Switch OLED, allowing for more versatile viewing angles ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=132s)). HOC notes that while it looks "skinny," it "does hold its position" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=177s)).
    *   An **additional USB-C port at the top** allows for charging while in tabletop mode or for accessories ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=140s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=92s)).
    *   The new dock supports **4K resolution output to a TV** and includes an **internal fan** to aid cooling during higher resolution gameplay ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=397s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=510s)). HOC also mentions the dock is curved and has a more guided structure for easier docking ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=496s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Improved build quality, better tabletop usability, and higher fidelity TV output.

*   **Increased Storage:**
    *   Internal storage has been significantly upgraded from 32GB to **256GB**, and it's faster ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=344s)). HOC estimates this should be enough for "at least six big Switch 2 games" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=901s)).
    *   **MicroSD Express card support** is retained for further expansion ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=380s)).
    *   **Benefit:** More space for larger Switch 2 games and faster loading times.

*   **Social & Sharing Features:**
    *   **Game Chat:** Activated by the new "C" button, this allows players to voice chat and screen share with friends on other Switches ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=430s)). An optional Switch 2 Camera accessory ($50) can put your face next to your gameplay ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=491s)).
    *   **GameShare:** Allows one Switch 2 owner to host a game and share it locally with up to three other Switch users who don't own the game ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=543s)). HOC calls this one of the "best thing[s]" and a feature that has "flown completely under the radar" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=906s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Enhances multiplayer experiences, making it easier to connect and play with friends, both remotely and locally.

*   **Backward Compatibility & Game Types:**
    *   The Switch 2 will play **native Switch 2 games**, **compatible Switch 1 games**, and **"Switch 2 Edition" games** (remastered/updated Switch 1 titles) ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=580s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=730s)).
    *   HOC confirms it can "completely play Switch One games, pretty much all of them, right out the box" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=731s)).
    *   **Benefit:** Access to a vast existing library while enjoying new, optimized titles.

### Reviewer Showdown

While generally aligned, reviewers had slightly different takes or emphasis on a few key areas:

1.  **LCD Display Quality (vs. OLED Expectations):**
    *   **MKBHD:** Notes the display is "still an LCD" and "not an OLED though, so it doesn't have the perfectly inky blacks or the battery life advantages that come with an OLED" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=81s)). He suspects a Switch 2 OLED might come later ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=90s)).
    *   **HOC:** Was "fully expecting the new console to have the same washed out colors" of the original Switch LCD but found "The Switch 2's display looks freaking phenomenal... I actually think the color reproduction on this LCD display comes out on top" when compared to the Switch OLED ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=251s)).
    *   **Reasoning:** Both acknowledge it's an LCD. MKBHD focuses on the inherent limitations compared to OLED. HOC, however, was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this specific LCD, finding its color reproduction superior even to the existing Switch OLED model, exceeding expectations for an LCD.

2.  **Joy-Con Durability/Build:**
    *   **MKBHD:** Expresses worry about the durability of the pins on the Switch console side for the magnetic Joy-Cons: "I kind of wonder how many little kids are gonna bend those pins" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=243s)).
    *   **HOC:** Feels the magnetic Joy-Cons are very solid, stating, "they feel very much like just part of the console" and praises the precise interlock design. Regarding the connector pins, HOC felt "it actually feels like it would be very difficult to accidentally snap it" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=169s)).
    *   **Reasoning:** MKBHD's concern is a general worry about a potentially fragile point of connection, especially with younger users. HOC's assessment comes from hands-on manipulation, finding the magnetic connection and the central connector surprisingly robust.

3.  **Perception of Game Graphics:**
    *   **MKBHD:** Generally positive about game visuals and performance improvements due to the new hardware.
    *   **HOC:** More nuanced. While acknowledging games like the new Mario Kart look "pretty good" with more detail and smooth 60fps ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=551s)), HOC "wouldn't say that I was blown away" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=567s)), noting "quite a lot of aliasing" and "simple" surface textures ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=573s)). However, HOC also posits that the extra power seems to be utilized for "world design," like allowing "24 racers instead of 12" and "seamlessly transition from map to map with no loading screens" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=614s)).
    *   **Reasoning:** MKBHD focuses on the upgrade from the previous Switch. HOC compares it more broadly, noting it's not PS5-level, but acknowledges that the power is being directed towards enhancing gameplay scope and fluidity rather than just raw visual fidelity, which they believe is what many Nintendo fans are looking for ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=637s)).

### Common Praises

*   **Significantly Improved Display:** Both reviewers lauded the larger, brighter, 1080p, 120Hz VRR screen as a major upgrade ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=126s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=208s)).
*   **New Magnetic Joy-Cons:** The larger size, better ergonomics, and satisfying magnetic attachment were well-received ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=157s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=130s)). The Joy-Con mouse functionality was seen as an innovative addition ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=277s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=430s)).
*   **Increased Storage:** The jump to 256GB of faster internal storage was a welcome improvement ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=344s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=901s)).
*   **Top USB-C Port:** The ability to charge while in tabletop mode thanks to the additional top port was highly praised ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=142s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=92s)).
*   **GameShare Feature:** Both reviewers liked this feature for local multiplayer ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=575s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=910s)).
*   **Backward Compatibility:** The ability to play existing Switch 1 games is a significant plus ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=730s)).
*   **Sturdier Build Quality:** The console feels more refined and less "janky" than its predecessor ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=125s)).

### Common Criticisms

*   **High Game Prices:** This was a major point of concern. MKBHD states Switch 2 games are reported to be "$80 bucks just for a digital download... 90 bucks if you want the physical version," which "definitely feels really high" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=662s)). HOC echoes this, calling them "new industry highs" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=812s)).
*   **Paid "Welcome Tour" Demo Game:** Both reviewers heavily criticized Nintendo for charging ($10-20) for the "Welcome Tour" demo game, which is designed to showcase the console's features. MKBHD called it a "huge miss" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=733s)), and HOC questioned why this equivalent to PlayStation's free "Astrobot" is a paid experience ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=860s)).
*   **Paid Upgrades for "Switch 2 Edition" Games:** HOC expressed concern that users will have to pay for upgrade packs for enhanced versions of Switch 1 games, which is "not really the norm" compared to free enhancements on other platforms like PlayStation ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=775s)).
*   **Game Chat Behind Subscription Paywall:** HOC questioned why "voice chat a feature so fundamental to basic console use [is] locked behind an online subscription paywall" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=850s)).
*   **Not an OLED Screen (for some):** While HOC was impressed with the LCD's color reproduction ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=251s)), MKBHD pointed out the lack of an OLED means missing out on the "perfectly inky blacks" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=84s)) and potential battery efficiency advantages that OLED technology offers ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=86s)). For consumers, this could translate to less vibrant colors and lower contrast in certain dark game scenes or viewing conditions compared to the visual punch of an OLED screen, which might be a drawback for users prioritizing top-tier display quality.

### Unanswered Questions

Several key questions remain that are important for potential buyers:

*   **Internal Specifications (Chip, RAM, DLSS Details):** While confirmed to have some form of DLSS for upscaling to 4K on a TV ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=774s)), the exact System-on-Chip (SoC), amount and speed of RAM, and the specifics of the DLSS implementation remain unknown. *Why it matters to buyers:* Understanding these internal components helps gauge the console’s future-readiness, its capability to run increasingly complex games smoothly over its lifespan, how effectively it can achieve and maintain target resolutions and frame rates, and how its overall performance will compare to other gaming devices on the market.
*   **Battery Life:** With a bigger, higher refresh rate screen, battery performance is a major question. It's unknown if the larger body accommodates a proportionally larger battery to offset this ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=784s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* For a hybrid console, portable play is a key selling point, and battery life directly impacts usability on the go.
*   **Joy-Con Drift:** A massive issue with the original Switch, it's unclear if the new Joy-Cons have addressed this. HOC finds it "really weird that nothing has been said about Joy-Con Drift" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=384s)), and MKBHD lists it as a TBD item ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=805s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* This is critical for long-term usability and potential additional costs if controllers need frequent replacement.
*   **Durability of Joy-Con Pins/Mechanism:** MKBHD specifically raised concerns about the pins on the console for the magnetic Joy-Cons bending over time ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=241s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* Potential durability issues could lead to repair costs or a compromised user experience.
*   **Game Save Data Transfer:** Can save data from original Switch 1 titles be transferred to their 'Switch 2 Edition' versions, particularly if these enhanced editions require a paid upgrade? *Why it matters to buyers:* For existing Switch owners with extensive game libraries and progress, the ability (or inability) to carry over their hard-earned saves to potentially superior versions of the same games is a significant practical and financial concern.
*   **Consistency of Game Pricing:** Will all Switch 2 games carry the new $80-90 price tag, or will there be variation? ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=933s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* Game prices significantly impact the long-term cost of owning the console.
*   **Support for New Features in Games:** How many third-party and first-party games will actually utilize features like the Joy-Con mouse or advanced Game Chat integrations? ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=937s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* The value of new hardware features depends on their adoption and implementation by game developers.
*   **GameShare Limitations:** What are the exact limitations and supported games for the GameShare feature? ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=942s)). *Why it matters to buyers:* Understanding the scope of this sharing feature is important for those planning local multiplayer sessions.
*   **Online Server Quality:** Given past issues with online play (e.g., "lag city" in Smash Bros. mentioned by HOC ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=960s))), will Nintendo invest in better online infrastructure? *Why it matters to buyers:* This is vital for a smooth experience with the expanded social and online multiplayer features.

### Concluding Thoughts

The Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be a thoughtful and significant evolution of a beloved console. It addresses many of the original's hardware shortcomings with a fantastic new screen, more ergonomic and innovative Joy-Cons, and welcome quality-of-life improvements like increased storage and an extra USB-C port. The promise of 4K docked output and new social features like Game Chat and GameShare add to its appeal ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=750s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=964s)).

However, the "grown-up" approach extends to its pricing, which is the primary caveat emerging from these early reviews. While the console price of $449 is considered "pretty reasonable" by MKBHD given inflation and upgrades ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=637s)), the steep cost of games ($80-$90), paid demo software, charges for game upgrades, and locking basic voice chat behind a subscription are significant concerns for both reviewers ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=655s), [HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=808s)).

Ultimately, the Switch 2 seems poised to be "really good again" ([MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U&t=764s)), offering a refined and more powerful hybrid experience. Potential buyers will need to weigh these substantial improvements against a potentially much higher overall cost of ownership. Many may wait "until there are games that they absolutely have to play" ([HOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hSp3pHHjg&t=987s)) before investing.
